    <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript language comes from the times when
        early web browsers were being developed.
        Netscape Communications company in 1994
        created Netscape Navigator that became the
        most popular web browser in the 90s.</p>

    <p>History of JavaScript JavaScript language comes
        from the times when early web browsers were being
        developed. Netscape Communications company in 1994
        created Netscape Navigator that became the most popular web browser in the 90s.
        Company’s board quickly realized that browsers
        should allow create more dynamic websites and do some activities that do server-side languages, like input
        validation.
        First Netscape Communications cooperate with Sun Microsystems to use in Netscape Navigator Sun’s programming
        language
        Java. Then they wanted adopting and embedding a existing programming language like Scheme, Perl or Python.
        Eventually
        they decided to create scripting language that would complement Java and has a similar syntax.</p>

    <p>In 1995 Netscape Communications employed Brendan Eich to develop scripting language for web browser. Eich
        prepared
        it in a very short time. First version of new language had Mocha name, whereas official version used in Netscape
        Navigator 2 beta version was called LiveScript. In the same 1995 year new developed scripting language was
        renamed
        to JavaScript and used in next beta version of Netscape Navigator 2. LiveScript followed a lot of Java features.
        This, but above all the desire to use the growing popularity of Java to call positive associations with a new
        language where reasons that it was finally called JavaScript. Also implementation of the language for
        server-side
        was introduced.</p>

    <p>In this time Microsoft to compete with Netscape decided to include scripting technologies in their browser. In
        1996
        they released Internet Explorer 3 with their own implementation of JavaScript called JScript.</p>

    <p>Since that time there were two versions of JavaScript. This brought a compatibility issues. Industry needs caused
        that decided to standardize language. Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International to “standardize the
        syntax
        and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language”. In 1997 was published
        the
        language specification called ECMAScript as a ECMA-262 standard. Other browser vendors could use this
        specification
        to prepare their implementation.</p>

    <p>In the following years, the development of JavaScript was continued and in cycles were released new versions of
        specification. Responsible for the development of JavaScript are Mozilla Fundation (which is successor of
        Netscape
        Navigator) and Ecma International.</p>
